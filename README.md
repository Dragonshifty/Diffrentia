Created in Unity and is available free-with-ads on Google Play.

How to play:

Upon entering you will be asked to pick one of four clans - Falcon, Fox, Cat, or Dragon.
Your choice will be remembered next time you start the game.


Main Game:

Short Description: 
Play a card higher than the card on the pile to gain the difference in points. Play a lower card and lose the difference. 
Match the clan to either double the points if higher or negate the damage (0) if a lower card.
Points go into a weekly high score against the other clans.

Long Description:
A game consists of playing through a full 52 pack of cards (where suits are now clans).
Five cards will be dealt out between you and the computer and a virtual coin toss decides who starts.
Both your hand and the computer's hand will always be automatically sorted in ascending numerical order from left to right.

After the first card has been played, you/the computer will try to lay a higher card.
Points will be awarded based on the numerical difference between the two cards (e.g a 10 on a seven will score three).
Likewise if a lower card is played, the difference is subtracted from your score (e.g a five on a 10 will score -5).

If the card you play matches the clan of the opponents card on a scoring turn, that score is doubled (10 of foxes on a 7 of foxes will score 6).
If you match the clan on a turn where you would lose points, all damage is negated (blocked) and no points are lost.

It's recommened you play a few turns of the main game before going on the the Clan Battle section.


On-screen display:

On the main game screen the four red numbers represent clan points that round (shown next to corresponding clan picture).
Big white number in upper left is you total score that round.
The number immediately below is how much you scored last turn.
The big number on the right is the total computer score, and underneath is their last points scored.

The number number the middle and circular graphic shows the remaining cards count and the graphic decreases alongside this, too.


Clan Battle System:

When you pick a clan at the start, you represent that clan and the computer represents the other three.
Points are gained by playing a scoring move with a card that is of your clan. 
The computer scores for the other clans.
You only retain those clan points if you win the game - in which case only your clan gains points and the other three do not.5
Likewise vice-versa - if you lose the other three clans score their accumulated points.
The goal is to score the most points before it resets at 6pm each Sunday (local time).
